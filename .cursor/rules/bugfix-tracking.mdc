# Bugfix Tracking (QA Failures + Follow-ups)

## When QA fails

- If a ticket is “done” but fails QA, create a **new bugfix ticket** (next sequential ID).
- The bugfix ticket must include:
  - **Fixes**: the original ticket ID (e.g. `Fixes: 0007`)
  - **QA failure summary**: what failed, in human terms
  - **Category**: pick one: `DnD`, `State`, `CSS`, `Build`, `Process`, `Other`

## Why

- We want a clear, auditable trail of problem points (what keeps breaking and why).
