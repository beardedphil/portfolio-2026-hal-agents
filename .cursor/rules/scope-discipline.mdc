# Scope Discipline (No Unrequested Changes)

- Implement **only** what the ticket requests.
- Do not change styling/behavior “while you’re here” unless:
  - it is required to satisfy an acceptance criterion, OR
  - it fixes a bug introduced by the task, AND it is documented.

## Required documentation when deviations are unavoidable

- If you must make a change not explicitly requested:
  - add it to `docs/audit/<task-id>-<short-title>/decisions.md` under **Unrequested changes (required)**:
    - what changed
    - why it was necessary
    - how a human can verify it in the UI

## Verification quality bar

- `docs/audit/<task-id>-<short-title>/verification.md` must include checks that confirm:
  - the requested change works, AND
  - adjacent UI did **not** regress (basic smoke checks).
