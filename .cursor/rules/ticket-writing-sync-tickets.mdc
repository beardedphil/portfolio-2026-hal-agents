# Ticket Writing: Always Run `sync-tickets`

When a Cursor agent creates or edits ticket files under `docs/tickets/`:

- Run `npm run sync-tickets` immediately after the change.
- Commit and push any resulting repo changes.

## Notes

- The script reads Supabase credentials from `.env` (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
- **Never commit `.env`** (it must remain ignored).
