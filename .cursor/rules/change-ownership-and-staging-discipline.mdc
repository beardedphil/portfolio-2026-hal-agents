# Change Ownership + Staging Discipline

## Only commit what your ticket changes

- An agent must only commit changes that belong to the **current ticket** they are implementing.
- **FORBIDDEN:** bundling unrelated file changes into the ticket commit (including stray edits, formatting passes, or leftover untracked files).

## Staging discipline (required)

Before committing ticket work:

- Review `git diff` and `git status` and ensure every changed file is expected.
- Stage only the intended files (explicit `git add <paths>`).
- If any unrelated changes exist:
  - revert them, delete them, or move them into a **separate ticket/branch**.

## Do not “fix someone else’s work” inside a ticket

- If you discover a problem outside the ticket scope (including process cleanup), do **not** fold it into the ticket.
- Create a new ticket (preferred) and fix it on its own branch.

## Branching requirement (ties to done-means-pushed)

- Ticket work must be performed on `ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` branches.
- Do not commit ticket work directly on `main`.
