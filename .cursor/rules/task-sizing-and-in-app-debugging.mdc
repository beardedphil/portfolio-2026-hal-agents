# Task Sizing + Verifiable Output

- Every coding task assigned to an agent must be as small as possible.
- The limiting factor on shrinking tasks/stories is that **each task must result in a human-verifiable change to the app**.
- Verification must require **no external tools** (no terminal, no devtools console, no logs).
- Prefer acceptance criteria phrased as: “A human can click/see X in the UI and confirm Y.”

# In-App Debugging Requirement

- The app must include whatever **in-app debugging/diagnostics UI** we need to understand failures.
- Do **not** rely on console output or logs for debugging during normal verification.

# Role Constraint (for now)

- In this phase, act as a **project manager**:
  - do not implement code directly
  - help organize thoughts and write prompts for other agents
