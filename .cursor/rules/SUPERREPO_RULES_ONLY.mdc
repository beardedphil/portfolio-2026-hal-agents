# Authoritative Cursor Rules Live in the HAL Superrepo

This repository is designed to be used as a **submodule** inside:

- `portfolio-2026-hal/` (superrepo)

## What to do

- Open your workspace at the **HAL superrepo root**: `portfolio-2026-hal/`.
- The authoritative global agent rules live at: `portfolio-2026-hal/.cursor/rules/`.

## Do not edit rules here

- This repo intentionally does **not** carry a full copy of `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` to prevent drift.
- If you need to change rules, edit them in the HAL superrepo.
