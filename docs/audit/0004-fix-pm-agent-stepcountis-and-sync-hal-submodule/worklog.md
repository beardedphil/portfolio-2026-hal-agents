# Worklog (0004-fix-pm-agent-stepcountis-and-sync-hal-submodule)

- Read ticket 0004 and implementation notes.
- Confirmed error: "The requested module `ai` does not provide an export named `stepCountIs`" when HAL imports `@hal-agents/agents/projectManager`.
- In `src/agents/projectManager.ts`: removed `stepCountIs` from the `ai` import; replaced `stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS)` with `maxSteps: MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` in the `generateText` call.
- Verified AI SDK supports `maxSteps` for tool loop limit (compatible with installed `ai` ^4.3.0).
- Created audit artifacts: plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review.
- Submodule sync: HAL's `projects/project-1` must be updated to the commit containing this fix (from the real repo). After pushing portfolio-2026-project-1, run in HAL: update submodule to that commit, commit the new pointer, push HAL main.
